#### Nice to know

____________________________

Our current stack is Java, Tomcat, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We are in the process of moving our codebase into P.E.R.N (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) stack. What is important is the ability to create functionality as well as connecting the entire stack together in a scalable manner.

**Remember**, your code must be run on a computer outside of your localhost, don't forget to write a detailed ***getting started*** in your README.md.
